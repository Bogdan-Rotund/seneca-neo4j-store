# seneca-neo4j-store

### Seneca node.js data-storage plugin for Neo4j.

This module is a plugin for the Seneca framework. It provides a
storage engine that uses Neo4j to persist data. This module is currently under development so consider it as alpha version.

The Seneca framework provides an 
[ActiveRecord-style data storage API](http://senecajs.org/data-entities.html). 
Each supported database has a plugin, such as this one, that
provides the underlying Seneca plugin actions required for data
persistence.
